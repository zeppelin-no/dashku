[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://www.heroku.com/deploy/?template=https://github.com/anephenix/dashku)

Note: If you deploy to Heroku, you will want to enable these features in Heroku Labs for your app:
    
    heroku labs:enable http-session-affinity
    heroku labs:enable http-end-to-end-continue

This will ensure that the app's use of WebSockets will work smoothly.

Installation (with Docker)
---

The best way to install Dashku with Docker is by using Docker Compose:

    docker pull anephenix/dashku
    docker-compose up

We will be working on getting linked containers to work with Dashku's docker container, as well as updating the container with the latest version of Dashku.

    git clone git://github.com/Anephenix/dashku.git
    cd dashku
    npm install

    mongod &
    redis-server &
    npm start
