Use CoffeeScript
===

If you wish to use [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) instead of JavaScript for the Widget's code, the good news is you can.

If you have a widget editor open, click on the JavaScript code tab, and then click on it again. You are now able to code in CoffeeScript.

If you wish to switch back to JavaScript, click again on the code tab.

NOTE: In a previous version of the app, the code was being converted automatically into CoffeeScript, and vice-versa. However, this functionality was buggy, so we have decided to remove that feature, which means you'll need to do the conversion by hand.
