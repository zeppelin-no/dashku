        "name"         : "Your Dashboard",
        "userId"       : "4fd1f55b7e9b8705a1000053",
        "_id"          : "4fd1f55b7e9b8705a1000054",
        "widgets"      : [],
        "css"          : "",
        "screenWidth"  : "fixed",
        "updatedAt"    : "2012-06-08T12:51:39.695Z",
        "createdAt"    : "2012-06-08T12:51:39.695Z"
