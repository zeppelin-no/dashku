Transmit data to the widget
===

Dashku works by having data pushed up to the widget via a HTTP API, rather than pulling that data from a pre-defined source like other dashboard services do.

In order to transmit data to your widget, you'll need a server script to send JSON data to your widget. Here's how:

1. Hover over the widget you want to transmit data to.
2. Click on the yellow round button in the top left corner. This will show the widget editor.
3. Click on the green "Download Server Script" button in the bottom right corner of the widget editor window.

  You'll see a modal window appear. It will present you with a choice of languages to download the script for.

4. Click on an option, and run that script in a command line terminal.

You'll see that the widget has received data from the server script. You are free to configure what that data is, as well as how the widget presents that data. This gives the opportunity to do the following:

- Monitor servers based on their CPU usage time, % Memory used, % Disk Space free, any stat of interest.
- Setup a Social Media dashboard monitoring mentions on Twitter, changes on Google trends, Facebook page comments, and other sources.
- Create an internal account management dashboard to monitor account sales and performance.
- Present realtime web app usage metrics as collated by a 3rd-party service.
- A news dashboard to monitor breaking news sources for new developments.
- A custom finance dashboard to show multiple charts of equities, indices, and commodities as their price changes instantly.

The use cases are boundless.
