Change the widget's size
===

You may want a widget that is bigger than the initial size given. The good news is that you can adjust the widget's size.

1. Hover over the widget, and place your mouse cursor over the drag icon in the bottom left corner.
2. When the cursor pointer changes to point in a south-east direction, drag and hold the handle to extend the widget's size.
3. When you are happy with the widget's size, let go of the handle.

You widget will take on that new size from now on.
